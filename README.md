🚗 Optimizing Vehicle Sales with Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on using Machine Learning and Geographical Clustering to optimize vehicle sales in Edmonton. By analyzing dealership data, sales trends, and geographical factors, we aim to help Go Auto make data-driven decisions on inventory distribution and marketing strategies.

🔍 What We Did
Applied K-Means and DBSCAN clustering to segment high-performing sales regions.
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover sales patterns, pricing trends, and dealership performance.
Utilized data visualization techniques (heatmaps, scatter plots) to present insights in a clear and actionable way.
Transitioned from postal code-based clustering to Forward Sortation Area (FSA)-based analysis for broader insights.
Integrated AutoCanada data to enhance dealership comparisons.
🚀 Key Outcomes
✅ Identified high-sales regions to improve dealership placement.
✅ Provided data-driven recommendations for marketing and inventory management.
✅ Built interactive visualizations for better decision-making.
✅ Proposed future optimizations using additional dealership attributes and real-time dashboards.
